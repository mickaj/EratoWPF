EratoWPF is an x64 application to find all prime numbers in given range. To achieve that it uses an algorithm based on Sieve of Eratosthenes (see Wikipedia).
EratoWPF was written in C# and XAML. It uses Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 and WPF 4.5, and according to MVVM pattern.
Maximum processed number is 2147483647 (int type) and to process maximum range the application may require huge (really huge) amount of RAF, therefore forcing it to operate on such vast range may lead to unexpected behaviour of your system, loss of stability and/or other effects.
